The artifact that I have chosen to include for the Databases portion of the final project is my Client/Server Development final project. For this final project I was tasked with creating a RESTful API for a database that served stock market data. The RESTful API allows to the user to send HTTP requests to server in order to retrieve financial data and reports from the server. I completed this project on October 25th 2020.

I selected this item because it demonstrates my understanding of client/server development principles. In completing this project, I was able to apply my knowledge of database systems concepts to develop a client/server application that interfaced client-side code with a database. The specific components of this artifact that showcase this is stock_API.py server application that created. This artifact has been improved upon with the addition of a flowchart that allows the user to better understand the design of this RESTful API.

I did meet the course objectives that I planned on meeting with this enhancement in Module One. I had stated that I was going to create a flowchart for this project and I have completed this objective. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans as of yet.

What I learned in improving this artifact was how to create a flowchart of a RESTful API. This was my first time creating a flowchart for a RESTful API and I found it challenging to create the diagram because I did not know where to start. After reviewing the code, I decided to start with the main endpoint of the RESTful server. I then created a logical connection for each route connected to the main endpoint. Finally, I created the logic for each route.
