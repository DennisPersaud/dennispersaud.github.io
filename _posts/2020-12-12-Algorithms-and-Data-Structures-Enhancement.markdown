The artifact that I have chosen to include for the Algorithms and Data Structure portion of the final project is my Foundation in Application Development final project. The application that I worked on is a management system for a Luxury Ocean Cruise company. The application allows the user to add or edit ships, cruises, or passengers as well as view information saved in the system. I completed this project on October 25th 2019.

I selected this item because it demonstrates my understanding of algorithms and data structures through my use of programming as a problem-solving technique in business and engineering applications. The specific components of this artifact that showcase’s this are the menu system and methods that I created within the projects Driver file. This artifact has been improved upon with the addition of a flowchart that allows the user to better understand the design and the flow of information through the program.

I did meet the course objectives that I planned on meeting with this enhancement in Module One. I had originally stated that I was going to create a flowchart for this project and I have accomplished this. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans as of yet.

What I learned as I was improving this artifact was how to create flowchart for a java project which contains multiple nested statements. Creating a flowchart for an application of this size was also a great learning experience in understanding how different components in this application work together. The main challenge that I faced while creating the flowchart was that there were a lot of if else conditions for the menu, which made it difficult to organize my diagram in a way that would not be too confusing to the viewer.
