The artifact that I have chosen to include for the Software Design and Engineering portion of my final project is my Software Reverse Engineering final project. The application that I reverse engineered is a program that allows the user to adjust the grades of a predefined set of students. I reverse engineered this file from an object file to assembly and then back into a functioning C program. I completed this project on June 25th 2020. 

I selected this item because it demonstrates my understanding of the software engineering process through my ability to reverse engineer a program. The specific components of this artifact that showcase this is the report that I created for this project, which details the entire step by step process that I took in order to reverse engineer the object file back into a functioning C program. The artifact was improved with the addition of a flowchart which allows user to better understanding the design of the program visually. 

I did meet the course objectives that I planned on meeting with this enhancement in Module One. I had stated that I was going to create a flowchart for this project and I have accomplished this. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans as of yet.

What I learned as I was improving my project was how to create a flow chart for C program loops, which I had not done previously. It was also insightful to map out the functionality of the program which improved my own understanding of this application. The challenges that I faced were going through each step of the program systematically in order to map out the program in its entirety.
